# Our Use of Aragon

We will delve into how we integrate and utilize Aragon's SDK and Aragon OSx in our system. While we have created our own custom frontend and [Diamond Governance SDK](https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/diamond-governance), we continue to use certain elements of Aragon's robust framework.

## Aragon SDK

While our platform primarily uses our own Diamond governance SDK, we continue to use the Aragon SDK for certain nice-to-have features.

For all other features such as members, fetching DAO variables/settings, proposal fetching and sorting, proposal voting, proposal execution, creating new proposals, and all other interaction with the DAO, we use our Diamond governance SDK.

### Treasury contents

Given the on-chain constraints, such as the inability to directly query all the ERC20 tokens an address holds (it is only easy to see the token balance, if you know the token you're looking at), we utilize Aragon SDK's functionality. Aragon's SDK effectively tracks all the contract events for our DAO's treasury wallet. This enables us to accurately visualize the token balances of the treasury.

### Transfers history

We use Aragon SDK to maintain a record of transfers to and from the treasury. This feature goes beyond a simple smart contract call, making it a valuable resource.

## Aragon OSx

Our DAO is built on the Aragon OSx contract. This serves as the base contract, which is generated by Aragon.

Here is a breakdown of what this contract handles:

### Permissions

Aragon OSx contracts handle permissions mapping. Here, an address can have a permission of another smart contract, enabling plugins to interact securely with each other. A permission consists of an address that has the permission, the contract where which the permission can be used, and the permission id.

### Action execution

Action execution is a permission that is granted to the governance plugin. This enables the governance plugin to execute actions on behalf of the DAO when consensus is reached.

### Storage of treasury

The Aragon OSx contract stores the treasury tokens in the DAO smart contract, allowing them to be withdrawn as an action.

### Plugins

Aragon OSx contracts facilitate plugins, which is a mapping of other smart contracts to which permissions are granted to interact with the DAO or other plugins. Currently, we have one plugin: The overarching Diamond plugin that contains a lot of facets to provide our desired functionality. This structure was chosen to enhance the modularity of the DAO and make it easier to add new features.

### Base security systems

The core Aragon OSx contract also has some base security systems to protect the DAO. It has been audited for security flaws over 3 times. Some of the audit reports can be found on [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/aragon/osx/tree/develop/audits).

## Flexibility and modularity

Because of our Diamond governance SDK, our reliance on Aragon OSx is minimal. This grants us the flexibility to switch to another DAO base contract, or even create our own later. We can continue using the same Diamond, only needing to transfer our treasury. As the members, token holders, and proposals are all stored in the Diamond, we would not lose any data in such a transition.
