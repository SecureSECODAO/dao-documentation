# Proposals

Proposals form the core of the DAO governance. They are used to make decisions for the DAO. A proposal can be created by any member of the DAO.
They can contain [actions](/actions), such as withdrawing assets from the treasury, changing DAO parameters or merging a Github PR.
These actions can be executed if the proposal has reached the required approval threshold and quorum (participation threshold).

## Proposal status

A proposal can have one of the following statuses:

- `Pending` - The proposal has been created and is waiting for the voting period to start.
- `Active` - The proposal is currently in the voting period. Every member can cast their vote.
- `Succeeded` - The voting period has ended and the proposal has reached the required approval threshold and quorum. The proposal can now be executed (to perform the attached actions).
- `Executed` - The proposal has been executed and the attached actions have been performed.
- `Defeated` - The voting period has ended and the proposal has not reached the required approval threshold or quorum.
