# Diamonds, Multi-Facet proxy

The SecureSECO DAO essentially boils down to the Aragon OSx contracts and our own **Diamond Governance** plugin.
The **Diamond Governance** plugin uses a modular smart contract system called the [Diamond pattern](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).
This pattern allows the DAO itself to add new functionality to the DAO without having to redeploy the entire DAO, providing upgradability and maintainebility.
It also circumvents the 24KB contract size limit on Ethereum.
