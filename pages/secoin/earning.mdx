# Earning SECOIN

SECOIN, the native token of the SecureSECO ecosystem, can be earned through several means:

## Mining

Miners have the opportunity to claim SECOIN in proportion to the hashes they've successfully mined. Additionally, they have the flexibility to decide the distribution ratio between SECOIN and [SECOREP](/secorep/earning).

        [1, 3],
      ],
    },
  }}

## Verification reward

Upon successful verification, users are eligible to claim a specific amount of SECOIN. Notably, this reward can be claimed independently for each provider that the user verifies with. The Verification Guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the verification process and how to claim the reward.

## Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC)

Users can acquire SECOIN through the [Augmented Bonding Curve](/secoin/abc) mechanism, by swapping their DAI tokens for SECOIN.

## Liquidity provision

The [liquidity pool](/secoin/liquiditypool) serves as another avenue for SECOIN acquisition. Users can directly swap tokens in the liquidity pool for SECOIN or earn SECOIN by contributing liquidity to the pool.

## DAO treasury withdrawal

DAO members hold the right to propose a withdrawal of SECOIN from the treasury. For instance, this can be employed to generate reward payouts upon bounty completion. Currently, there's no explicit functionality for creating bounty-specific proposals. However, members can adopt a DIY approach by initiating a standard proposal to see if the DAO is interested in the bounty, and once it's achieved, follow up with a proposal for [treasury withdrawal](/actions/withdraw-assets).
