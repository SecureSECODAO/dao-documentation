# SECOIN Contract Structure

SECOIN is a type of token that follows the [ERC-20 token contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) standard. This standard is a set of rules and guidelines followed by many tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Unlike our other token SECOREP that is part of the [Diamond Governance](/diamond), SECOIN operates independently.

SECOIN's contract is quite simple. It features a few important functions that create (mint) and destroy (burn) tokens as needed for [ABC](/secoin/abc) operations. However, only a specific part of the system, the MarketMaker contract of the ABC, can use these functions.
