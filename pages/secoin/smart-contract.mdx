# SECOIN Contract Structure

SECOIN operates on a [ERC-20 token contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), independent from the [Diamond Governance](/diamond) plugin and its facets.

The contract, designed as a straightforward [ERC-20 (metadata) contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20Metadata), incorporates exposed mint and burn functions, crucial for the [ABC](/secoin/abc) operations. Note, however, these functions are secured with an authentication layer exclusively accessible to the MarketMaker contract of the ABC, so only the ABC can use the mint and burn functions.

For more comprehensive information on the ERC-20 standard and IERC20Metadata interface specification, you can consult [Ethereum token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) and [IERC20Metadata interface specification](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20Metadata).
