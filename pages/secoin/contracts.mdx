# SECOIN Contracts
The ERC-20 token contract for SECOIN is a separate (standalone) contract from the diamond governance plugin (and all their facets).
The contract itself is a simple ERC-20 (metadata) contract with an exposed "initial mint" function. 
This initial mint function is used to mint the initial supply of tokens to the DAO treasury (for the ABC).
