# SECOIN Contracts
The [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token contract for SECOIN is a separate (standalone) contract from the [Diamond Governance](/diamond) plugin (and all its facets).
The contract itself is a simple [ERC-20 (metadata) contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20Metadata) with an exposed mint and burn function. 
This mint and burn functionality is needed for the [ABC](/secoin/abc). It does have authentication on it, which is only granted to the MarketMaker contract of the ABC.

The deployed contract can be found at: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/token/0x10941b83d2c881ec157784b896be23d2b0e1acf7?a=0xaf7e68bcb2fc7295492a00177f14f59b92814e70#code
