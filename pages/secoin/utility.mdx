# The Utility of SECOIN

SECOIN is the native currency of the SecureSECO DAO and forms the backbone of our querying system.

## Queries

SECOIN's primary role lies in facilitating SearchSECO queries. It serves as the exclusive medium of payment for these queries, ensuring seamless and efficient exchanges within our distributed ledger system. The pricing of the queries is also described in the quering guide as well.
