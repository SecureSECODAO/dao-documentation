# Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) for SECOIN

The Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) is a vital component of the economic design of SECOIN.
Here we aim to provide an understanding of what an Augmented Bonding Curve is, its reasons for implementation, and how it operates.

## What is an Augmented Bonding Curve?

An Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) is a specialized financial strategy used in blockchain technology. It helps control how a token (a type of digital asset) is created and priced. Think of it as a bridge that helps transfer value from a specific public group (we call it 'Commons') to the rest of the world.

ABC does two main things:

1. It borrows ideas from the traditional bonding curve but also adds new features to keep prices stable and make it safer for those who hold tokens.
2. It also acts as a never-ending fundraising tool for organizations that create and keep public goods going. This results in a cycle of value within the Commons, which helps them remain financially healthy.

The ABC is designed to address an issue known as the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem). This is a situation where people benefit from resources but don't pay or pay too little for them. The ABC addresses this by setting up mini-economies that are always liquid (easy to trade) and offer alternative funding sources that encourage the right behavior for shared resources.

With bonding curves, the price of tokens is determined continuously using algorithms. In an ABC, tokens are made (minted) or destroyed (burned) right through the smart contract. This allows for automatic price adjustment based on the present supply of tokens.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Here are the revised sections:

## Why We Chose an Augmented Bonding Curve?

### Stability and Security

One of the key advantages of an ABC is the stability it provides. By basing the value of SECOIN on a predictable price function, an ABC can prevent abrupt shifts in SECOIN value, reducing the risk for holders. Moreover, the design of the ABC helps to moderate drastic price changes by ensuring that SECOIN isn't created from nothing, further bolstering its inherent value.

The ABC model is designed in such a way that it helps in maintaining balance in the market. When the demand for SECOIN is on the rise, the protocol slows the price growth by minting more SECOIN and rewards the DAO. On the other hand, when there's a downturn in the market, the protocol eases the selling pressure by reducing the supply (burning SECOIN), which in turn rewards the SECOIN holders by increasing their share of the collateral. This mechanism ensures a win-win situation for all parties involved, reinforcing the stability and security of the DAO.

### Friction as a Mechanism

Friction is a key feature in the ABC model, taking the form of fees during the minting and burning processes. These fees support the ecosystem and promote stability. During the SECOIN burning process, an exit fee is imposed, with a small portion of the returns going back into the Funding Pool (Treasury), facilitating the ongoing funding of the commons while contributors earn returns.

It's important to note that when a user mints SECOIN, a part of their deposit amount is directed to the DAO. Although there is no explicit entry fee during minting, this transfer could be seen as an inherent cost. On the other hand, when a user burns SECOIN, they incur an exit fee, even though nothing is sent to the DAO at this stage. These fees contribute to the friction mechanism and play a critical role in managing price dynamics and ensuring security.

## How does the Augmented Bonding Curve work for SECOIN?

SECOIN's Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) is a flexible, adaptable incentive system that guides collective behavior towards common goals.

At its core, the ABC model comprises two main components: the Reserve Pool, holding bonded DAI and SECOIN, and the Funding Pool or Treasury, which together form a self-sustaining financial mechanism.

SECOIN's ABC skips the usual initial phase, known as the Hatch Phase, in our first version to facilitate experimentation and quick adaptation to market conditions. Instead, we start directly with the Open Phase, where anyone can mint SECOIN by contributing DAI to the curve, effectively becoming 'members of the Commons'.

The price-supply relationship of SECOIN is determined by a formula, currently the Bancor formula, shaping our bonding curve. However, this formula is not static. It can be changed by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) based on collective decision-making, and it takes the Reserve Ratio (and others) as an input parameter. However, the DAO can choose to ignore the reserve ratio if deemed necessary.

Key variables within the ABC, which are also subject to DAO modification, include:

- Theta: This is the percentage of minted SECOIN that goes to the Treasury, contributing to the ongoing funding of the Commons.
- Friction: This is the percentage that remains within the ABC when SECOIN are burned, thereby enhancing the value of the remaining SECOIN.
- Reserve Ratio: This ratio impacts the bonding curve's shape, thus influencing how SECOIN's price responds to supply changes.

In essence, SECOIN's ABC is designed to foster a secure, stable, and adaptable token ecosystem. By understanding these variables and mechanisms, community members can actively shape SECOIN's financial landscape.

## The Curve

The ABC uses Bancor's mathematical formula to shape the bonding curve. This formula determines the relationship between token supply and price.

A crucial component of this formula is the **Reserve Ratio**. This ratio influences the curvature of the bonding curve, which in turn affects how the token price responds to changes in supply. A higher Reserve Ratio leads to a flatter curve, meaning token prices are less sensitive to supply changes. Conversely, a lower Reserve Ratio results in a steeper curve, making prices more responsive to changes in supply.

In conclusion, the ABC is a sophisticated model designed to maintain the stability and security of the SECOIN system. Its use of friction, bonding curves, and other financial tools helps to foster a more predictable and robust token ecosystem. By understanding these mechanisms, you can make more informed decisions about participation in SECOIN's economy.
