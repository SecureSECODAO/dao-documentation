# Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) for SECOIN

The Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) is a vital component of the economic design of SECOIN. This comprehensive document aims to provide an understanding of what an Augmented Bonding Curve is, its reasons for implementation, and how it operates.

## What is an Augmented Bonding Curve?

An Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) is a specialized financial strategy used in blockchain technology. It helps control how a token (a type of digital asset) is created and priced. Think of it as a bridge that helps transfer value from a specific public group (we call it 'Commons') to the rest of the world.

ABC does two main things:

1. It borrows ideas from the traditional bonding curve but also adds new features to keep prices stable and make it safer for those who hold tokens.
2. It also acts as a never-ending fundraising tool for organizations that create and keep public goods going. This results in a cycle of value within the Commons, which helps them remain financially healthy.

The ABC is designed to address an issue known as the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem). This is a situation where people benefit from resources but don't pay or pay too little for them. The ABC addresses this by setting up mini-economies that are always liquid (easy to trade) and offer alternative funding sources that encourage the right behavior for shared resources.

With bonding curves, the price of tokens is determined continuously using algorithms. In an ABC, tokens are made (minted) or destroyed (burned) right through the smart contract. This allows for automatic price adjustment based on the present supply of tokens.

## Why We Chose an Augmented Bonding Curve?

### Stability and Security

One of the key advantages of an ABC is the stability it provides. By basing the value of tokens on a predictable price function, an ABC can prevent abrupt shifts in token value, reducing the risk for holders. Moreover, the design of the ABC helps to moderate drastic price changes by ensuring that tokens aren't created from nothing, further bolstering their inherent value.

### Friction as a Feature

Friction is an integral part of the ABC model and takes the form of entry and exit fees. These fees act as a means of supporting the ecosystem and promoting a more stable environment. When tokens are burned for withdrawal, an exit tax is enacted on liquidation. A small percentage of the returns are sent back into the Funding Pool (Treasury), allowing for simultaneous funding of the commons while contributors earn returns.

## How does the Augmented Bonding Curve work for SECOIN?

SECOIN's ABC creates an incentive mechanism, driving group behavior toward common goals and giving users the power to design the incentive mechanisms that will shape their Commons.

In our system, we model a Reserve Pool (a reserve of bonded DAI and a supply of tokens) and a Funding Pool (Treasury) that work together to create a self-sustaining funding mechanism for a continuous organization.

We launch our system in two stages: the Hatch Phase and the Open Phase. During the Hatch Phase, initial contributors participate in a hatch sale, bootstrapping the Commons by funding an initial goal. A percentage is put into the Reserve Pool and "bonded" to the curve, and a percentage is put into the Funding Pool (Treasury).

The Hatchers receive newly minted tokens specific to the Commons. These tokens undergo a vesting process, helping to ensure the stability of the Reserve Pool and to prevent harmful early speculation. Once the goal for the Hatch Sale is met, the vesting process is initialized, and the system enters the Open Phase. In this phase, anyone can mint tokens by contributing DAI into the curve, thus becoming 'members of the Commons'.

## The Curve

The ABC uses Bancor's mathematical formula to shape the bonding curve. This formula determines the relationship between token supply and price.

A crucial component of this formula is the **Reserve Ratio**. This ratio influences the curvature of the bonding curve, which in turn affects how the token price responds to changes in supply. A higher Reserve Ratio leads to a flatter curve, meaning token prices are less sensitive to supply changes. Conversely, a lower Reserve Ratio results in a steeper curve, making prices more responsive to changes in supply.

In conclusion, the ABC is a sophisticated model designed to maintain the stability and security of the SECOIN system. Its use of friction, bonding curves, and other financial tools helps to foster a more predictable and robust token ecosystem. By understanding these mechanisms, you can make more informed decisions about participation in SECOIN's economy.
