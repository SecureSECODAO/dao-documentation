# Querying the SearchSECO database

## Overview

The Query functionality enables you to search the SearchSECO database for information about GitHub repositories. By entering the URL of a specific GitHub repository and your GitHub access token, you can query the database for relevant data.

## Query Guide (Webapp)

Follow these steps to use the Query feature:

<Steps>

### Enter the GitHub URL

In the Query form, find the field labeled "GitHub URL". Here, enter the URL of the repository you want to query. Make sure it's a valid GitHub URL, or you'll receive an error.

### Enter your GitHub Access Token

Below the URL field, there's another field labeled "GitHub Access Token". Input your personal GitHub access token here. This token needs read access to the repository you wish to query. If it's invalid, an error message will be shown.

### Submit the Query

Click the "Submit" button to initiate the querying process. The application first validates your URL and GitHub Access Token. If no validation errors occur, the query process begins and you'll see a "Querying SearchSECO database..." message.

### Pay for Hashes

Once the query is complete, you'll receive information about the cost and number of hashes found in the "Results" section. If you decide to continue, press the "Pay for hashes" button to pay for the session. Following this, a transaction request is sent to your wallet for approval.

### Review Results

After the payment confirmation, the data will be fetched from the SearchSECO database. You can inspect these results in the "Results" section. If you want to download the result, hit the "Download as JSON" button.

### Cancel Session

If you want to cancel the session at any point, simply click the "Cancel" button. Be aware that this will permanently delete the current session and any data received. So, ensure to download your data before cancelling the session if you need it.

Remember that your GitHub Access Token is sensitive information. Make sure not to share it with anyone else. The token is stored in your local storage for ease of use but can be removed or overwritten at any time.
