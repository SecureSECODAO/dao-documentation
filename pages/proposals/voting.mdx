# Voting on Proposals

All created proposals are listed on the [Governance page](https://dao.secureseco.org/governance) and can be voted on by the community. Only _active_ proposals can be voted on.

<Steps>
### Connect your wallet
First, you need to connect your wallet to the DAO. This can be done using Metamask or a variety of other wallets. Don't have
a wallet? Create one by following the steps [here](/joining/installing-metamask).

### Find an active proposal

Navigate the [Governance page](https://dao.secureseco.org/governance) and find an active proposal that you would like to vote on. You can filter proposals by their status using the tabs near the top of the page. Click on the title of a proposal to go to its page.

### Vote on the proposal

On the proposal page, you can see the voting options and the current voting results on the top left card, under the header. To vote, select the option you would like to vote for (either "Yes", "No" or "Abstain") and then click the "Vote" button.

**Note: you cannot change your vote once it has been submitted.**

You will automatically vote with all of the SECOREP that you owned at the time that the proposal was created, _but the SECOREP will remain yours and can be used to vote on other proposals_. If you own more SECOREP than the maximum voting power (for that specific proposal), your vote will be capped at the maximum voting power. All of the SECOREP above the cap will, however, still count towards the quorum.

### Approve signature

Once you clicked the button, your wallet will notify you of a signature request. After accepting this request, your vote will be submitted to the DAO.

### Await confirmation

It may take a short time for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. When it is confirmed, the proposal will be updated, and you'll be able to see your vote in the votes section of the proposal page.
