# SecureSECO Coin

SecureSECO Coin (SECOIN) is the _monetary token_ for the [SecureSECO DAO](/about/dao). SECOIN serves as the native currency of the DAO, functioning as the medium of value exchange and store of value. It is used to reward and therefore incentivize contributions to the DAO, and allows users to transfer tokens from one another as a form of payment.

## Transparency and security

Similar to the governance token, monetary tokens in the DAO ecosystem operate on public blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Transactions involving SECOIN are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and immutability, and allowing participants to verify and validate the token transfers and balances.
