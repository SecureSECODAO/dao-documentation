# SECOREP Contract Structure

SECOREP, a non-transferable [ERC-20 token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), incorporates an exposed mint and burn function, both of which necessitate auth permissions for operation.

Instead of being deployed as a standalone contract, SECOREP operates as a facet of the [Diamond Governance](/diamond). This design choice reflects its intended role not as a standalone token, but as a governance token within the [SECOREP DAO](/dao/what-is-a-dao) ecosystem. Additionally, as part of the diamond, it offers increased flexibility. For instance, it could potentially be upgraded to an [ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) standard, should the DAO decide.

To delve deeper into the ERC-20 standard and IERC20Metadata interface specification, you can consult [Ethereum token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) and [IERC20Metadata interface specification](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20Metadata).
