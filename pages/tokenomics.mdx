# Introduction to SecureSECO DAO's Tokenomics

SecureSECO DAO operates a dual-token structure comprised of a governance token (SECOREP) and a monetary/utility token (SECOIN). This unique system brings numerous benefits that cater to our ambition of fostering a decentralized, robust, and transparent ecosystem.

## Why two tokens?

Implementing a dual-token system offers a series of advantages that strengthen the mechanics of our ecosystem:

1. **Ensuring Democratic Governance:** We firmly believe that governance power within a DAO should be earned and not purchased. By separating our governance token from our utility token, we ensure that decision-making power comes from active participation and valuable contributions over time, not financial strength.

2. **Separation of Monetary and Governance Functions:** Distinguishing the governance and monetary utilities into two tokens enables us to sidestep potential conflicts between the two. This separation facilitates a more targeted development and maintenance of both the governance structure and the token economy.

3. **Enhanced Security:** The split of functionalities provides an additional security layer to our system. Any potential attack or exploitation is limited to one aspect of the system, without affecting the other.

4. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The two-token model allows for greater adaptability in response to evolving network demands and market conditions, and increased flexibility in the management of the ecosystem.

5. **Inclusivity:** By differentiating governance from monetary transactions, we establish a more inclusive system. Users can participate in the networkâ€™s economy without necessarily being involved in its governance, and vice versa.
