# hello

An organization partially or wholly managed by decentralized computer program, with voting and finances handled through a blockchain, using smart contracts. DAOs are member-owned communities without centralized leadership. For DAOs, the legal status is unclear.

Practically, for Secure SECO
No owner (sorry Slinger!)
Partial governance by deterministic smart contract execution
Existence does not depend on one person
Democratic, depending on design
Identity is a challenge (who’s who, and why trust them?)

For resources that:
are at risk of capture by a central actor
depend on community empowerment and engagement
In situations where a need exists for:
deterministic execution of governance decisions
extremely flexible and scalable governance structures
For pioneers that hope for:
More innovation and experimentation in organization and technical structures
A more decentralized and fair society

Core values:
Trust data is all around us, but we don’t use it properly
Trust data does not belong to the big software companies, it should be available for all
Trust data should be managed as open source, without the possibility to poison the well

How it works in practice
The (Dutch) SecureSECO foundation is run by a board with very little power
Money is made when data is “sold”
Money is spent when data is added to the DAO
Money is spent on new initiatives and features for TrustSECO and SecureSECO
We introduce a kill switch, if the DAO starts rapidly bleeding money
