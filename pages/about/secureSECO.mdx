# SecureSECO

## What is SecureSECO?

## Motivation (from slides, herschrijven Thijn en eigen dingen toevoegen, dit kwam ik gewoon tegen)

We want to enable software engineers to achieve their goals
We want software engineers to work with secure software
We want to provide a layer of trust under the worldwide software ecosystem
We want to enable full provenance of source code to the place where it is used
We want to use the data about this provenance for finding and warning about software vulnerabilities
We love the open source space and its ability to self-cleanse
We look at the worldwide software ecosystem and donâ€™t discriminate on language, technology, platform, or other sub-ecosystem

## Goal of the SecureSECO Initiative

Goal: The Secure Software Ecosystems initiative takes a worldwide scope on the produced software that society depends on. We hunt for software vulnerabilities and propose methods for eliminating them. We collect and analyze data on why software is to be trusted.
We subsequently research, design, and build prototype systems that use trust data for providing trustworthy reliable systems for consumers and industry.
These systems are frequently underpinned by open distributed systems that provide guarantees for reliable open untamperable data.
