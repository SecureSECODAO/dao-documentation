# Diamond Cut

<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸ›‡">
  The diamond cut action is an advanced action. It is only relevant for members
  who have thorough knowledge of smart contract programming and [diamonds
  (ERC-2535)](/diamond). It is not possible to create a proposal with a diamond
  cut action using the DAO webapp.

## What is a diamond cut
A diamond cut is a way of changing the functionality of the DAO. It can be used to add, replace or remove functionality of the DAO. For example you could create a diamond cut to change the current [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) based voting to [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) (NFTs). For this to work you would have to write an ERC-721 governance structure facet smart contract. As this action can have huge consequences if not considered carefully, this action can only be created using smart contract calls. This serves as a first test to see if you know what you are doing. Helper functions for create a proposal with a diamond cut action are provided in the Diamond Governance repo, for which you can follow the guide bellow.

<Steps>
  
## Create diamond cut proposal guide
### Clone the Diamond Governance repo
This repo can be found at [https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/diamond-governance](https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/diamond-governance).
  
### Build the Diamond Governance repo
Follow the build process in the setup section of the readme. 
  
### Create the .env file
Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and fill out the required properties. This will likely only be your private key for the desired network.
  
### Fill in the settings in the proposal generator script
Add your diamond address, cut and proposal metadata to `scripts/GenerateDiamondCutProposal.ts`.

### Run the proposal generator script
The script can be run with `npx hardhat run ./scripts/GenerateDiamondCutProposal.ts --network { your desired network name }`

### Finished!
You can now checkout the webapp and see your proposal in all its glory!
