# Change Parameters

The DAO has many [facets](/diamond/facets), also referred to as _plugins_, and each facet can have multiple variables which can be changed by the DAO, known as _parameters_.

Using the change plugin parameter action, these facet variables can be changed through proposals.
The [settings page](https://dao.secureseco.org/settings) shows all changeable parameters, their current value, and a description explaining what it entails.
