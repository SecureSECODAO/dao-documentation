The DAO has many [facets](/diamond/facets), which for user convenience are also called plugins.
Each facet can have multiple variables, which for user convenience are also called parameters.

Using the Change plugin parameter action, these facet variables can be changed.
The [settings page](https://dao.secureseco.org/settings) shows all changeable parameters, and a description per parameter.

The 'Parameter value' field contains the value that is directly passed to the smart contracts.
Therefore, careful attention must be payed to this field.
