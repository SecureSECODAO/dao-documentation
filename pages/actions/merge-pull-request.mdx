# Merge Pull Request

The DAO can vote to merge open pull requests within the [SecureSECO DAO Github organization](https://github.com/SecureSECODAO).
This is useful to govern the maintenance and development of SecureSECO repositories.

### Merge checks

This action will only merge the pull request if all the branch protection rules have been met.
This often includes the requirement of all tests passing and the branch being up to date with the base branch.

### Available repositories

The actual merging is done by the [SecureSECO-DAO Github account](https://github.com/SecureSECO-DAO).
Therefore, this action can be used to merge pull request for all repositories for which the bot has merge permissions.
In short, this action can be used to merge pull request in all the repositories of the [SecureSECO DAO Github organization](https://github.com/orgs/SecureSECODAO/repositories).
