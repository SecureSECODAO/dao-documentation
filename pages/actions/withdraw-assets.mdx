The withdraw assets action can be used to withdraw assets from the DAO treasury.

For example, you might use this action to reward someone for their contributions to the SecureSECO DAO.

### Known tokens
Withdraw known tokens, i.e. tokens that are already in the treasury (SECOIN and MATIC). 
1. Enter the address of the recipient for the recipient field.
1. Select the token type you wish to withdraw using the token selector.
1. Enter the amount of the token for the amount field. Note that this field supports decimals, thus for example it is possible to withdraw 0.0000000000001 MATIC.

### Custom token address
Withdraw custom tokens, i.e. NFTs or tokens that are currently not yet in the treasury.

#### Custom token address - MATIC
It is possible to withdraw MATIC using 'Custom token address', in case the treasury does not yet contain MATIC.

1. Enter the address of the recipient for the recipient field.
1. Select 'Custom Token Address' using the token selector.
1. Select 'Native token: MATIC' using the token type selector.
1. Enter the amount of MATIC for the amount field.

#### Custom token address - ERC20
ERC20 is a standard used by most monetary tokens
1. Enter the address of the recipient for the recipient field.
1. Select 'Custom Token Address' using the token selector.
1. Select 'ERC20: Most monetary tokens' using the token type selector.
1. Enter the address of the ERC20 contract of the token for the 'token address' field.
1. Enter the amount of the token for the amount field.
1. The token decimals field should automatically be filled based on the token address.
If this is not the case, this often means that the token address is incorrect! If you are sure the token address is correct, you can provide the token decimals manually if required.
