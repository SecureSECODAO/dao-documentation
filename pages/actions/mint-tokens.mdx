# Mint Tokens

The mint tokens action can be used to mint new SECOREP tokens to the wallet with the specified address.

<Callout variant="info" emoji="â“˜">
  Note: SECOIN cannot be minted straight to a wallet. To send SECOIN to an
  address, you can use the [withdraw assets](withdraw-assets) action.
</Callout>

### Minting to multiple wallets

You can mint to multiple wallets with a single mint tokens action.
This can be done by clicking the 'Add wallet' button.
Therefore, it is not possible to add multiple mint tokens actions to a single proposal.
