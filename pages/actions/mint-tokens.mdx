The mint tokens action can be used to create new SECOREP and send this to the specified address.

Please note that SECOIN can not be minted. To send SECOIN to an address, you can use the [withdraw assets](withdraw-assets) action.

### Minting to multiple wallets
With one mint tokens action, you can mint to multiple wallets.
This can be done by clicking the 'Add wallet' button.
Therefore, it is not possible to add multiple mint tokens actions to a single proposal, as that would be redundant.
