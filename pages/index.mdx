# Welcome to SecureSECO DAO

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  This is the official user documentation for the SecureSECO Decentralized
  Autonomous Organization (DAO). Whether you're a developer, a contributor, or
  someone just interested in our cyber security project, you're in the right
  place!
</Callout>

Through the SecureSECO project, we aim to make the worldwide software ecosystem a safer place by maintaining a distributed ledger of facts about software that is used in the field.

The main purpose of the DAO is to incentivize contributions to SecureSECO in a sustainable manner. To this extent, it will also manage the treasury, and handle the governance of the organization. Security should be a public good, and we believe that a DAO is the best way to achieve this.

## Getting Started

Embarking on your SecureSECO DAO journey is simple and straightforward.

To begin, ensure you have [Metamask](/joining/installing-metamask) installed. Metamask serves as your connection to the blockchain, allowing you to interact with our DAO.
Once Metamask is set up, you're ready to join the DAO! Head over to our [webapp](https://dao.secureseco.org/) and proceed with the [verification process](/joining/verification). This critical step authenticates your participation within our ecosystem.
As a new member, don't forget to claim your initial reward as well as your daily reward. You can learn more about this process in our [SECOREP Earning guide](/secorep/earning).

Now, you're all set to dive deeper into the DAO. Interested in making a proposal or understanding how the proposal system works? Navigate to our [Proposal System section](/proposals).
Are you ready to make a query to SearchSECO? Head to our [SearchSECO guide](/searchSECO) to understand how to effectively interact with our distributed ledger system.

We're thrilled to have you with us as we make the worldwide software ecosystem a safer place. Let's start this exciting journey together!
