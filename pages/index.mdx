# Welcome to SecureSECO DAO Documentation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  This is the official documentation for the SecureSECO Decentralized Autonomous
  Organization (DAO). Whether you're a developer, a contributor, or someone just
  interested in our cyber security project, you're in the right place!
</Callout>

Through the SecureSECO project, we aim to make the worldwide software ecosystem a safer place by maintaining a distributed ledger of facts about software that is used in the field.

Our DAO is here to incentivize contributions to SecureSECO in a sustainable manner, ensure the management of a treasury, and govern itself. We've designed it to be self-sustaining and require minimal maintenance after project completion.

We have implemented two types of tokens in our ecosystem:

- `$SECOREP`: A non-transferable governance token used for voting and rewards in the DAO.
- `$SECOIN`: A monetary token used for mining rewards, rewards and query payments.

Explore our documentation sections as follows:
