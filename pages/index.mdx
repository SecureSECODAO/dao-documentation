# Welcome to SecureSECO DAO Documentation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  This is the official user documentation for the SecureSECO Decentralized
  Autonomous Organization (DAO). Whether you're a developer, a contributor, or
  someone just interested in our cyber security project, you're in the right
  place!
</Callout>

Through the SecureSECO project, we aim to make the worldwide software ecosystem a safer place by maintaining a distributed ledger of facts about software that is used in the field.

Our DAO is here to incentivize contributions to SecureSECO in a sustainable manner, ensure the management of a treasury, and govern itself. We've designed it to be self-sustaining and require minimal maintenance after project completion.
