If you're interested in contributing to the SecureSECO DAO project, you've come to the right place!

There's several modules that work together to make the SecureSECO DAO work:

- [DAO Webapp](/https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/dao-webapp) - frontend webapp for the DAO
- [Diamond Governance Plugin](https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/diamond-governance) - plugin for the base DAO contracts that adds all of the functionality specific to the SecureSECO DAO
- [SearchSECO API](https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/searchSECO-api) - API that handles the interaction between the DAO and the SearchSECO database
- [Verification Server](https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/member-verification) - server and smart contract that handles user verification for the DAO
- [Github PR Merger](https://github.com/SecureSECODAO/pr-merger) - bot that merges PRs on Github based on proposals in the DAO

All of these modules accept your contributions!
