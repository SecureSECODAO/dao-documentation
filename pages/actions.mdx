Actions can be executed through the use of [proposals](/proposals).
Actions can have real world effects outside of the DAO, such as merging github pull request.
Actions can also have effects on the DAO, for example changing DAO parameters such as the amount of REP for the daily reward.

If you are a developer and want to cut (add/replace/remove) a [diamond facet](diamond/facets),
then you can not use the DAO webapp to create a proposal for this action.
