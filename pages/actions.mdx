# Actions

Actions are essentially operations/method calls that will execute some code on a smart contract. They can be used to do all sorts of things, from minting SECOREP tokens to changing the DAO's parameters.
Actions can also have real world effects outside of the DAO, such as merging a Github pull request.

Actions are attached to proposals, and can be executed by the DAO's members if the proposal passes the voting stage.
