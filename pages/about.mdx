# About

This is a project under the umbrella of [SecureSECO](/about/secureSECO), with the purpose to provide an organization to manage contributions to the SearchSECO project. In the future, this organization may be used to manage other SecureSECO project, such as TrustSECO, as well.

This project has been initially developed by a team of students at Utrecht University, in comission of the SecureSECO foundation.
