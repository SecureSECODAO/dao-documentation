from slides of Krishna, pls rewrite:

What is SearchSECO?

A hash based index for code fragments that enables searching source code at the method level in the worldwide software ecosystem.

Comprises of a miner (which includes spider, crawler, parser), Cassandra DB and a Database API.

We spider and crawl through the worldwide software ecosystem, indexing all methods found into searchable hashes which includes author, license and vulnerability information.

Methods are similar when they have the same parse tree

We hash an abstract representation of a method, to enable fast searching through the worldwide software ecosystem

We find clones on a worldwide scale, far larger than the typical project scope

Method level license violation checking
We store the version metadata of project with date and the license. This enables us to check if any code clone matches violate the license of
a) The projects from which code is borrowed and/or
b) The projects that borrow your code
We perform a detailed one-to-one method license checking with the help of license compatibility matrix from OSADL and provide an explanation for a violation (or compatibility).

This is an example report for a facebook repo which has code matches from various repos including a repo with GPL-2.0 license.

GPL-2.0 is a strong copyleft license which restricts code being borrowed to similar restrictions. Hence, borrowing project cannot have the Apache 2.0 license.

The report contains explanations for the conflicts as well.

We are also performing a study to look at license violations in the worldwide software ecosystem, and initially looking at large software companies with a large industry influence (most starred orgs on GitHub)

We have found a lot of potential violations and are looking deeper into the kind of violations and how they can be reported/prevented.

SearchSECO and DAO
To monetise SearchSECO, DAO aims to provide monetisation mechanism for:
Hosters submitting methods to the database
Users can host a crawler, mine GitHub for methods and submit them to the database. They are then provided with a reward based on the number of methods submitted.
Users using SearchSECO to check for matches
Users can check the SearchSECO database for matches, vulnerabilities and license violations for which they are charged based on the number of methods queried.

Server restructuring
Restructured 3 cassandra nodes to a single monolith node for with 2 replicas; trading fault tolerance for better performance/cost.

Current setup has 2 servers, one running cassandra node, API and Grafana; other running the frontend portal and Prometheus.
Kubernetes cluster for mining
We are currently running 2 miners on the existing servers which are also being used for the API, DB and portal.

We will be migrating this to a kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling and fault tolerance.

Rewriting the project to JS
Our current controller is written C++ has issues like:

Not handling web requests with grace
Deadlock in specific repos
Resource heavy (Surprisingly!)
A rewrite is planned of the controller from C++ to JS and also use a better parser compared to the ones used now (SrcML -> Treesitter)
Software Improvement Group collaboration
SIG is interested in using SearchSECO for matching code in repo to specific version of libraries which is not available in any tool currently.

A software project has been conducted with 11 bachelor students

Over 28M methods indexed (7M unique), nearing 40k projects on GitHub

Including author and license information

Parsing Python, C(x), Java, and Javascript

Currently improving performance, so we can “mine” even faster

Thorough consideration of the ethical questions around developer data collection

Roadmap includes:
Advanced method-level license checking
“Business model” so that use of the data is paid for with more mining
Vulnerability marking for identifying vulnerable fragments in a project
