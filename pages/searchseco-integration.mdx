# What is SearchSECO?

SearchSECO is a hash-based index specifically designed for code fragments, facilitating
method-level source code search throughout the global software ecosystem. The initiative
employs parsers to extract fragments (methods) from code files making them findable.
This allows for more precise license checks, vulnerability searches, and extraction
of call graphs from the identified methods.
Additionally, the project reveals relationships between code fragments, code files, and their
projects in the global software ecosystem. The fine-grained data propels empirical
software engineering and repository mining forward by enabling more in-depth analyses.

In the core of SearchSECO, methods are treated as central units of data. These
methods are considered similar when they possess identical parse trees. The
system hashes an abstract representation of a method to enable swift searching
throughout the global software ecosystem. It further identifies clones on a global
scale, well beyond the typical project scope.

## Integration with the SecureSECO DAO

The SecureSECO DAO provides a monetization mechanism for hosters submitting methods
to the database, and users using SearchSECO to check for matches.
Users can host a crawler, mine GitHub for methods, and submit them to the database.
They are then rewarded based on the number of methods submitted. Conversely, users
can check the SearchSECO database for matches, vulnerabilities, and license violations,
and they are charged based on the number of methods queried.

## Architecture

SearchSECO's architecture comprises three primary components: a miner
(which includes a spider, crawler and parser), a Cassandra database, and a Database API.
The miner spiders and crawls the global software ecosystem, indexing all detected
methods into searchable hashes, encapsulating author, license, and vulnerability information.

To strike a balance between performance and cost, we have streamlined our server architecture
by merging 3 Cassandra nodes into a single monolithic node, with 2 replicas.
Our existing setup includes 2 servers. One server hosts the Cassandra node, API, and Grafana,
while the other accommodates the frontend portal and Prometheus.

At present, we operate two miners on the existing servers, which are also utilized
for the API, database, and portal. We plan to transition these miners to a Kubernetes
cluster, incorporating auto-scaling and fault tolerance to optimize operational efficiency.

SearchSECO also provides detailed method-level license checking with the help of
a license compatibility matrix from OSADL. It offers explanations for any license
violation (or compatibility) by storing the version metadata of a project with the
date and license. This setup facilitates license violation checks for both the projects
from which code is borrowed and the projects that borrow code.

## Current State & Roadmap

As of today, SearchSECO has successfully indexed over 28 million methods, including
7 million unique methods, from nearly 40,000 GitHub projects. Our system efficiently
handles author and license information, and supports parsing for Python, C(x), Java,
and JavaScript languages. While we strive for continuous performance improvements to
speed up our "mining" process, we are mindful of the ethical considerations involved
in developer data collection.

Our previous controller, developed in C++, has encountered several issues, including
sub-optimal handling of web requests, deadlocks in specific repositories, and
surprisingly high resource consumption. To address these challenges, we are currently
rewriting the controller in JavaScript and plan to employ a more efficient parser
(transitioning from SrcML to Treesitter) in the future.

The Software Improvement Group (SIG) is keen to utilize SearchSECO for matching
code in repositories to specific versions of libraries, a feature not available
in existing tools. Our collaboration with SIG promises exciting prospects and has
already given rise to a software project involving 11 bachelor students.

Our future roadmap for the SearchSECO project includes:

- Advanced method-level license checking
- Implementation of a “business model” where data usage funds more mining
- Vulnerability marking to identify vulnerable fragments within a project
