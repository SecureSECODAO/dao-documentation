# Joining through Verification

<Callout type="warning" emoji="âš ">
  For verifying using Github, your account needs to be at least 1 year old.
</Callout>

One of the ways to join the DAO is by verifying your identity.
Currently, only [Proof of Humanity](https://proofofhumanity.id/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are supported but we are working on adding more platforms.

## Verification guide

<Steps>
### Connect your wallet

First, you need to connect your wallet to the DAO. This can be done using Metamask or a variety of other wallets. Don't have
a wallet? Create one by following the steps [here](/joining/installing-metamask).

### Pick a platform

Go to the [verification page](https://dao.secureseco.org/verification). You will be presented with
a list of platforms that you can use to verify your identity. Click the 'Verify' button of the
platform you want to use.

### Approve signature

Once you clicked the button, your wallet will notify you of a signature request. If you accept this request,
a specific message will be signed using your wallet, after which it is sent to our server. This is needed
to prove that you own the wallet.

### Sign in to the platform

After you have approved the signature request, you are redirected to the chosen platform. Here you
will need to sign in to your account. If you are already signed in, you will be redirected back to the
verification page instantly. Note that for GitHub, your account needs to be at least 1 year old.

### Finish verification

If everything went well, a new card should be visible on the right side of the page under the "pending verifications" section.
Clicking the "Finish" button will ask you to approve a transaction. Approving this transaction will call a smart contract function.
Once this transaction is confirmed, you have been successfully verified on the chosen platform.

### Claim your reward

If this is the first time you have verified your identity with the chosen platform, you will be able to claim a reward.
A new card will appear on the right side of the page, informing you how much you can claim. Clicking the "Claim reward" button
will once again ask you to approve a transaction. When the transaction has been processed, you will receive your reward!
The reward is given in the form of a token called `SECOREP`. This token is used to vote on proposals and will be explained in
more detail in the [SECOREP](/secorep) section.

## Reverification

Your verification status is not permanent. Depending on the platform you verified with, you will need to reverify yourself
after a certain amount of time. Simply press the "Reverify" button on the card of the platform you want to reverify with.

## Unverification

It is also possible to unverify yourself. This can be done by clicking the "Remove" button on the card of the platform you want to unverify from.

## Technical details

### Process overview

Firstly, the user must visit the verification webpage and link their digital wallet (like Metamask, for instance). From there, the user must select one of the available identity verification providers, which currently includes Github and Proof of Humanity.

After selecting a provider, the user will be directed to the provider's site for identity verification. In the case of Github, this process is carried out via [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/).

Following successful verification, the user is redirected back to our server which receives a verification token. This token allows our server to confirm the user's identity. Once confirmed, the server generates a proof which the user can then use to verify their identity on-chain.

The proof is assembled as follows:

    - Various data elements are collated:
        - User's address
        - A hash, derived from the combination of:
            - Unique user-specific data (for example, the Github username)
            - The ID of the provider (for instance, "github")
            - An undisclosed secret
        - The current timestamp
    - This assembled data is then signed using a private key, which must originate from the same wallet that deployed the /block smart contract.

The user can then use this proof to verify their identity on-chain using the smart contract. This is accomplished by invoking the verifyAddress function, which is as simple as clicking a button. Upon execution, the smart contract authenticates the proof, and if deemed valid, records the data on-chain.

## Stamps

On-chain verifications are encapsulated using a construct known as a stamp. A stamp is a data structure comprising the following fields:

```solidity
struct Stamp {
    string providerId; // Unique identifier for the provider (github, proofofhumanity, etc.)
    string userHash; // Hash of unique user data from the provider (username, email, etc.)
    uint64[] verifiedAt; // Array of timestamps indicating when the user was verified
}
```

Every user can have multiple stamps.
