# Joining through Verification

<Callout type="warning" emoji="âš ">
  For verifying using Github, your account needs to be at least 1 year old.

One of the ways to join the DAO is by verifying your identity.
Currently, only [Proof of Humanity](https://proofofhumanity.id/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are supported but we are working on adding more platforms.

## Verification guide

<Steps>
### Connect your wallet

First, you need to connect your wallet to the DAO. This can be done using Metamask or a variety of other wallets. Don't have
a wallet? Create one by following the steps [here](/joining/installing-metamask).

### Pick a platform

Go to the [verification page](https://dao.secureseco.org/verification). You will be presented with
a list of platforms that you can use to verify your identity. Click the 'Verify' button of the
platform you want to use.

### Approve signature

Once you clicked the button, your wallet will notify you of a signature request. If you accept this request,
a specific message will be signed using your wallet, after which it is sent to our server. This is needed
to prove that you own the wallet.

### Sign in to the platform

After you have approved the signature request, you are redirected to the chosen platform. Here you
will need to sign in to your account. If you are already signed in, you will be redirected back to the
verification page instantly. Note that for GitHub, your account needs to be at least 1 year old.

### Finish verification

If everything went well, a new card should be visible on the right side of the page under the "pending verifications" section.
Clicking the "Finish" button will ask you to approve a transaction. Approving this transaction will call a smart contract function.
Once this transaction is confirmed, you have been successfully verified on the chosen platform.

### Claim your reward

If this is the first time you have verified your identity with the chosen platform, you will be able to claim a reward.
A new card will appear on the right side of the page, informing you how much you can claim. Clicking the "Claim reward" button
will once again ask you to approve a transaction. When the transaction has been processed, you will receive your reward!
The reward is given in the form of a token called `SECOREP`. This token is used to vote on proposals and will be explained in
more detail in the [SECOREP](/secorep) section.
