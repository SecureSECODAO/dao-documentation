  Please note that the voting method is typically reserved for individuals with
  a compelling reason to avoid joining through verification, such as VIPs or
  those with specific circumstances. As DAO members must cast a vote on the
  proposal, passing it might be challenging. If you believe you have a valid
  reason, feel free to [contact](/contact) us.

Joining our DAO via a voting process is an alternative way of becoming a member. It requires existing members of the DAO to propose your addition through a vote. This method of joining is typically reserved for individuals who have a good reason not to join through the [verification](/joining/verification) process.

## Membership rights

Membership gained through a vote grants you the same rights as if you had joined through [verification](/joining/verification). You will not need to undergo the re-verification process, since your address won't expire, courtesy of the separate mapping applied to whitelist members through vote.

## Reputation rewards

As a member, you are eligible for maximum [daily reputation rewards](/secorep/earning), the same as if you had joined through verification and passed both verifications. If you are already a member of the DAO through a vote, you can still earn the initial reward by [joining through verification](/joining/verification).

## Joining process

If you wish to join the DAO via a vote, here is an overview of the process:

1. An existing member of the DAO needs to initiate a proposal using the [whitelist member action](/actions/whitelist-member) containing your address.
2. The DAO members will vote on your proposed addition.
3. If the vote passes, you will become a member of the DAO.

The existing member will need to follow the steps outlined in [creating a proposal](/proposals/creating-proposals), using the [`Whitelist Member action`](/actions/whitelist-member) with your address as the `Address` parameter.
